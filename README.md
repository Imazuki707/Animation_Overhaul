## Compatibility

One of the main reasons behind the development of this mod was that the alternatives weren't compatible with famous mods such as _Better Combat_, _Emotecraft_, _Spell Engine_, among others.
**Animation Overhaul fixes that by adding special support for those mods!**

## Configurability

From enabling individual animations to changing their speed and transitions! Completely configurable.

## Resource Pack Support

Want your own animations instead? You can change the animations using a resource pack!
